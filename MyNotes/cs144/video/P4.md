Why is the IP service so simple?

- **Simple dumb minimal**: faster more streamlined and lower cost to build and maintain
- The end-to-end principle: Where possible, implement feaatures in the end hosts.
- Allows a variety of reliable (or unreliable) services to be built op top.
- Works over any link layer: IP makes very efw assumptions about the link layer below.



The IP Service Model(Details)

1. Tries to prevent packets luuping forever (TTL)
2. Will fragment packets if they are too long.
3. Uses a header checksum to reduce chances of delivering datagram to wrong destination.
4. Allows for new versions of IP
   - Currently IPv4 with 32 bit addresses
   - And IPv6 with 128 bit addresses
5. Allows for new options to be added to header
